When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I work with other people, I want to use a remote repository. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I like pulling changes manually because that way, when I'm working on code, it doesn't change without me expecting it. For example, if I know the new version of some code is broken, I might not want to pull that change until the bug is fixed.
