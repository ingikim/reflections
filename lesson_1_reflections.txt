What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

	I can have commit message. It's very helpful to understand what commit means. But when I forget to commit, I will be hard to restore code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because the files tracked by Git are interrelated. While others, like Google Docs's files, couldn't be interrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	I could type 'git log' to view the history off files. I also could type 'git diff first_id second_id' to view difference between first_id and second_id.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	I could use 'git checkout commit_id' command.
